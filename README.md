# Dataset 8 DROPBEAR Acceleration vs Roller Displacement


This data set consists of acceleration data measured from the Reproduction of Projectiles in Ballistic Environments for Advanced Research (DROPBEAR) experimental testbed with movable roller support as shown in Figure 1. This dataset was developed as an extension to Dataset-2 <a href="https://github.com/High-Rate-SHM-Working-Group/Dataset-2-DROPBEAR-Acceleration-vs-Roller-Displacement">here</a> with an emphasis on the generation of data in the quality and quantity needed to apply machine learning approaches. A video of the older test configuration can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB6AUWgWyJU&ab_channel=ARTS-LabattheUniversityofSouthCarolinaARTS-LabattheUniversityofSouthCarolina">here</a>.

For the test in this dataset, DROPBEAR consists of a 51 x 6.66 x 501 mm beam with two accelerometers mounted on the cantilever beam and two strain gauges.
